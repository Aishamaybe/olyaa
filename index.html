            <h9>I wrote a state about children's harm making movie watching,
                This text talks about why parents should be careful about what movies their kids watch. 
                It mentions things like violence, scary stuff, and too much time in front of screens. It also talks about how movies can sometimes show bad behavior or too many ads. 
                It says parents should help kids pick movies wisely and make sure they see different kinds of people in movies.
